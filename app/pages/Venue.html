<h2>Venue</h2>
<h4>Inspace</h4>
<p>Inspace is a research lab with a difference: the experiments going on inside it will often be visible from the outside, and members of the local community will be able to visit it to experience creative uses of computing and communications technologies.</p>
<p>The main aim of the lab is to explore ways of making "smart spcaes": places that sense and respond to the people in or near them. The interactions can be playful or serious, for entertainment or education.</p>
