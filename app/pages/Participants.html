<h4>Alistair Burns <br/>Senior Developer / Line Digital</h4>
<!--<a href="">website link</a>-->

<p>Ally is a Senior Developer at Line Digital Limited, and has been working professionally in the web industry since graduating with a Computer Science degree from Edinburgh University in 1999.</p>
<p>In this time he's developed a large number of database driven websites, and has often had to perform complex data migrations to port websites from old, inflexible legacy systems to new systems, built on top of well documented open source frameworks. This requires a good understanding of data structure and relationships between various entities.</p>
<p>One of the most fun aspects of working on database driven sites is the possibility of capturing various statistics and presenting them visually – for example representing various website visit statistics using pie charts, line and bar graphs. Ally was visually representing useful statistics well before Google Analytics was freely available for all to use!</p>
<p>Ally lives and works in Edinburgh, and interests outside of web development include football, badminton, mountain biking and films.</p>
