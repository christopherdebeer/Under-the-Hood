<h2>The Brief</h2>
<h4>Get involved</h4>

<p>Line Digital are producing a data visualisqation event on April 16 2011 for the public during the <a href="#">Edinburgh International Science Festival</a>. Our event will showcase how data can be visualised in different ways by creatives. Our raw data set will be provided by <a href="#">Festivals Innovation lab</a> using the theme 'Edinburgh as a Festival City'. Our plan is to allow three types of creatives to interpret the data in their own way. Line Digital and Festivals Innovation Lab will work together to offer sufficient and coherent data to each of the participants. The three types of creatives we are looking for are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Technical</li>
    <li>Audio</li>
    <li>Visual</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you're a creative and want to get involved, <a href="#">download the brief</a> and get in touch! All proposals will be gratefully recieved but Line Digital will make the final decision on the team on the day. All proposals need to be submitted by April 9 2011.</p>
<p>If you are interested in being part of this event, or need more information, please contact:</p>
